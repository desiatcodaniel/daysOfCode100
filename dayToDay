This will be my day to day coding log for the challenge. I will study uploading photos along the way and format this better.

Day1: I connected my github account to my freecodecamp account which made me lose all my JavaScript progress.
It is not a lot (Just finished Arrays). But I will get my progress back to where it used to be without including that in my
challenge time.
