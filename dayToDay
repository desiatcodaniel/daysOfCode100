This will be my day to day coding log for the challenge. I will study uploading photos along the way and format this better.

Day1: 

-I connected my github account to my freecodecamp account which made me lose all my JavaScript progress.
It is not a lot (Just finished Arrays). I will get my progress back to where it used to be outside my codeChallenge hours.
-I finished Chapter 2 of the book.
-I finished the Looping Triangle and FizzBuzz exercise.
-After researching more about learning web development, I have decided to follow the path of learning HTML, CSS, then JavaScript.
-More than 50% complete with FCC's HTML and HTML5 Basics. I will study the proper coding style of HTML.
-Got my main source book for HTML & CSS. I will read it at work during my free time.

Day2:

-Finished HTML and started CSS at FCC. 
-Started practicing what I'm learning through making my envisioned blog website/portfolio.
