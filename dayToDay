This will be my day to day coding log for the challenge. I will study uploading photos along the way and format this better.

Day1: 

-I connected my github account to my freecodecamp account which made me lose all my JavaScript progress.
It is not a lot (Just finished Arrays). I will get my progress back to where it used to be outside my codeChallenge hours.
-I finished Chapter 2 of the book.
-I finished the Looping Triangle and FizzBuzz exercise.
-After researching more about learning web development, I have decided to follow the path of learning HTML, CSS, then JavaScript.
