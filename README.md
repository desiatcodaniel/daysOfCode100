#100DaysOfCode
This is my challenge to learn whatever I can about Front-End Web Development in 100 days at least 1 hour a day.

About me:
- I took 4 Classes of C++ (Introduction up to Data Structures), 2 Classes of Java (Introduction up to OOP), 1 class of Machine Languge (Very easy topics if you have already taken any CS classes) and 1 class of Assembly Language (One of those languages for me that either clicks, or not at all - In my case it clicked, but not interested), and 1 online class in MySQL(Basics).
- I have mostly learned how to code to finish my assignments and group projects to get at least Bs in all those classes. I get lazy whenever I know I'm getting an A and just stop practicing or going to class(I go back to class when I get back down to B again - Yey!).
- I regret not taking advantage of my privilege to learn all those stuff without worrying about any expenses.
- I realized how hard real life can be when I got married 2 years ago (I don't regret marrying the best person I've ever met, and we struggle together during the hard times).
- I am now trying to learn Front-End Web Development while working full-time.

I will be updating at least my dayToDay everyday until I finish the challenge or until I finish a medium sized project.
I will be learning git to upload and update my codes that I plan to write.
